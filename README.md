Discrete-event simulation (three-phase A–B–C) in Python/OOP for an M/M/1 queue. Uses a future event list (FEL) with arrivals (b1), departures (b2), and conditional service start (c1). Exponential interarrival (mean 3) and service (mean 2). NumPy-based, reproducible via seed. Reports clock, arrivals, departures..
